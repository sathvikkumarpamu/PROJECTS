**Project Title:** Smart Mirror that Shows Real-Time Weather Information  
**Technology:** IoT | Embedded Systems | Arduino | Cloud API Integration  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

The **Smart Mirror** is a futuristic IoT-based innovation that combines a **reflective mirror surface** with an **embedded digital display**.  
It seamlessly presents **real-time weather updates**, allowing users to stay informed while going about their daily routines.  

Designed for **HackAduino 2K25**, this project demonstrates how **smart devices** can enhance modern living through **embedded intelligence** and **cloud integration**.

---

## 🎯 Aim  

> To design and develop an IoT-enabled smart mirror that integrates a reflective surface with a digital display, showing real-time weather information fetched from the **OpenWeather API**.

---

## 🧠 Concept Insight  

The Smart Mirror merges **aesthetics with intelligence**:  
- The **mirror layer** provides the traditional reflective surface.  
- The **digital display (LCD)** behind the mirror dynamically shows live data such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **weather conditions**.  
- The **ESP32 microcontroller** fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and updates the mirror display periodically.  

> 💡 In essence — a “Mirror with a Mind,” that keeps you updated before you step out!

## ⚙️ Circuit Components and Description

### 1️⃣ **LM386 (U1) – Audio Amplifier IC**
A low-voltage audio power amplifier that provides a **20–200× gain** depending on external connections.

| **Pin** | **Name** | **Function** |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 & 8 | Gain Control | Adjusts the amplification factor (connect capacitor for higher gain). |
| 2 | Inverting Input | Usually connected to ground or signal reference. |
| 3 | Non-Inverting Input | Receives the input audio signal. |
| 4 | Ground | Connects to the negative battery terminal. |
| 5 | Output | Drives the speaker via coupling/filtering components. |
| 6 | VCC | Connected to the positive terminal of the 9V battery. |
| 7 | Bypass | Optional pin for noise filtering (connect capacitor to ground). |

## 🧠 Abstract

The **4-bit magnitude comparator**, an essential component in **Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)** and **Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)**, is implemented using multiple **full adder topologies**:

- Traditional Full Adder  
- Full Adder using **2×1 Multiplexer**  
- Full Adder using **2 XNOR + 1 MUX**  
- Full Adder using **NAND Gates**  
- Full Adder using **1-XNOR, 1-XOR, and 2 MUX**

An **ML-based prediction model** is incorporated to forecast **power**, **delay**, and **area** metrics—guiding optimal design selection.  
Simulation results using **Cadence 45nm CMOS** confirm the **NAND-based design** as the most **energy-efficient** comparator architecture.

## ⚙️ VLSI Scaling and Design Motivation

### Key Challenges in Modern VLSI Design:
- Rising **power dissipation** and **leakage current**  
- Reduced **reliability** at smaller nodes  
- Balancing **performance vs. power** during **device scaling**

### Scaling Techniques:
| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Voltage Scaling** | Reduces power but increases propagation delay. |
| **Load Scaling** | Reduces dynamic power by lowering load capacitance. |
| **Technology Scaling** | Shrinks device dimensions for faster performance. |
| **Transistor Width Scaling** | Balances speed and area efficiency. |

## 🤖 ML-Driven Design Optimization Loop

### 🔁 Workflow:
1. **Design Space** – Defines parameters: logic styles, voltage, transistor sizing.  
2. **Machine Learning Algorithm** – Predicts best configuration using regression or Bayesian optimization.  
3. **Circuit Simulation** – Uses Cadence Virtuoso for delay, power, and area analysis.  
4. **Performance Evaluation** – Compares EDP (Energy-Delay Product) for all architectures.

This loop accelerates design iteration by **eliminating redundant simulations** and **selecting high-performing designs** early in the process.
